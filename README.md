# Web Optimization Algorithms 
## Introduction
This project involves implementing custom sorting and searching algorithms without relying on built-in Python functions. The focus is on understanding the efficiency of different algorithms, such as iterative sorts and recursive binary search, and their applications in real-world scenarios like database management and web development.
## Technologies Used
- Python 3
* Pytest for testing

## Features
- Iterative Sort: Implemented an  `O(nÂ²)` sorting algorithm. This includes classic techniques like Bubble Sort, which, despite its simplicity, offers substantial learning insights into algorithm optimization.
* Recursive Binary Search: Implemented using recursion, showcasing an `O(log n)` search efficiency, ideal for sorted data arrays.
+ Application in Web Development: Integrated these algorithms into freelance projects to enhance features such as product sorting by popularity and price on e-commerce platforms
